'm all in my bag
This hard as it get
I do not snort powder
I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt
But I'm liable to trip
I ain't popping no pill
But you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends
I love 'em to death
I got a few mil'
But not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission
That's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron
Get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy
He gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was praying I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothing
If I smoke a rapper
It's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout
It won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't selling the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows
It's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas
I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OG's
I'm thanking you now
Was watching you when you was paving the ground
I copied your cadence
I mirrored your style
I studied the greats
I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me
You ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo
Still made all that noise
This shit gon' be different
I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
